# Backbone.Giraffe.js TodoMVC Example

> __Backbone.Giraffe__ is a light and flexible library that extends
[__Backbone.js__](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) to new heights.
__Giraffe__'s goal is to follow the __Backbone__ philosophy of unopinionated
simplicity to provide commonly needed features with few assumptions. It differs
from other __Backbone__ libraries like __Marionette__ and __Chaplin__ in its
reduced scope and size, and it takes a different approach to the problems of
route handling, object lifecycles, event aggregation, and view management.
